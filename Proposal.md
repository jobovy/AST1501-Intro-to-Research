# The proposal

The first step in your research project is to write a proposal. In this proposal, you 
will describe the motivation for your project, the broader context of your project,
the background material necessary to understand your project, 
and the methods you will use to carry out your project. If you have any preliminary
results, you could include them in your proposal (but this is not required!). Your 
proposal will be improved by feedback from your peers and you will present the 
proposal to the class at the end of November.

## Proposal deadlines

For quick reference, here are the various deadlines for the proposal:

* **First draft**: Oct. 31
* **Peer feedback**: Nov. 9
* **Revised draft**: Nov. 16
* **Presentations**: Nov. 21, 28

## Proposal guidelines

Your proposal should be 3-5 pages long, single-spaced, and use the 
[AAS LaTeX template](https://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex/aasguide.html); please 
use the default single column with a 10 point font style. You should write your 
proposal on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), so you 
can easily share it with your supervisor, your peers, and with the course instructor. The 
detailed structure of the proposal is up to you, but it should definitely contain 
(i) an introduction, (ii) a detailed timeline for the project, and (iii) a list of
references. As discussed above, you will need to motivate your project, provide the 
broader context and the background material, and describe the methods and/or data 
you will use to carry out your project and you should arrange this material into 
sections and subsections as you see fit. The timeline should give a detailed breakdown
of the tasks you will need to complete to finish your project and the dates by which
you expect to complete each tasks; the cadence should be at least monthly milestones, 
but further subdivision is encouraged. The references should be in the AAS format and
use ``bibtex`` to manage the references. You should use the ``\citep`` and ``\citet``
commands to cite references in the text.

The proposal should be submitted by email to the course instructor by the deadline, 
both as an attached PDF file and as a link to the Overleaf project. You will also have 
to email your proposal to your assigned peers (see below).

## Peer feedback

Once you have written a first draft of your proposal, you will exchange your proposal
with two peers and provide feedback on their proposal (the course instructor will 
assign peers for everyone). The peer feedback should be written as a short plain-text
email and should be constructive and critical. You should provide feedback on
all aspects of the proposal and, if appropriate, suggest ways to improve the proposal. 
The peer feedback should a few hundred words long (it can include a brief summary of 
the proposal).

The peeer feedback should be sent by email to both the 
proposal's author and the course instructor by the deadline.

## Revised draft

After receiving feedback from your peers, you should revise your proposal and submit
a revised draft. The revised draft should be submitted to the course instructor by the
deadline, again as a PDF file and as a link to the Overleaf project.

## Presentations

You will present your proposal to the class at the end of November. This presentation 
should give an overview of your project and the proposal. The presentation should be 
ten minutes long, which will be followed by 5 minutes of questions. After the 
presentation, please also email a PDF version of the slides to the course instructor.
