# The final project

THe final part of your research project is to write up a summary of your project 
in the style of a scientific paper. Like for the proposal, this paper will be improved 
by feedback from your peers. You will also present your final project to the class
at the end of the semester.

## Final project deadlines

For quick reference, here are the various deadlines for the final project:

  * **Abstract for final talk**: Feb. 26
  * **First draft**: Mar. 21
  * **Peer feedback**: Mar. 29
  * **Revised draft**: Apr. 5
  * **Presentations**: mid April

## Final project write-up guidelines

The final write-up of your research should take the form of a letter-style scientific 
paper. Letters are short papers that present a significant advances in a particular 
field of research. They are typically 4-5 pages long and a limited number of figures 
(usually no more than 5). The exact format of the paper is up to you, but generally 
letters have an abstract, an introduction, a methods section, a results section, and 
a discussion and conclusion section. Depending on your project, you may also want to 
include a separate data section. 

Like for the proposal, you should use the [AAS LaTeX template](https://journals.aas.org/authors/aastex/aasguide.html); please use the default single column with a 10 point font style. You should 
write your final paper on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), so you 
can easily share it with your supervisor, your peers, and with the course instructor.
The references should be in the AAS format and
use ``bibtex`` to manage the references. You should use the ``\citep`` and ``\citet``
commands to cite references in the text.

The final paper should be submitted by email to the course instructor by the deadline, 
both as an attached PDF file and as a link to the Overleaf project. You will also have 
to email your proposal to your assigned peers (see below).

## Peer feedback

Once you have written a first draft of your final paper, you will exchange your proposal
with two peers and provide feedback on their proposal (the course instructor will 
assign peers for everyone). The peer feedback should take the form of a referee report, 
as we will discuss in class on March 4. 

The peer feedback should be sent by email to both the 
proposal's author and the course instructor by the deadline.

## Revised draft

After receiving feedback from your peers, you should revise your final paper and submit
a revised draft. The revised draft should be submitted to the course instructor by the
deadline, again as a PDF file and as a link to the Overleaf project.

## Presentations

You will present your proposal to the class in mid-April. This presentation 
should give a comprehensive overview of your project. The presentation should be 
fifteen minutes long, which will be followed by 5 minutes of questions. After the 
presentation, please also email a PDF version of the slides to the course instructor.
