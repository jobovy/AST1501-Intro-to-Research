* Have a good understanding of the variety of research pursued in the astronomy units at the University of Toronto.

* Have experienced research in two separate research areas.

* Be able to write a research proposal.

* Be able to present their research to their peers and to faculty members.

* Be able to summarize their research in the form of a scientific paper.

* Understand how to search and access the astronomical literature

* Be able to use the Python programming language to solve research problems.

* Have basic familiarity with the UNIX command line.

* Be able to use version control to manage their research code.

* Be able to use the LaTeX typesetting system and collaborative writing tools to write research papers.

* Have a basic understanding of the use of statistics in astronomy.

* Be able to provide critical and constructive feedback on their peers' research.

* Have an advisor for the rest of their PhD!

Expectations:
* You are expected to (and encouraged to!) to get feedback on your proposal, presentations, and final write-up from your supervisor, research-group co-workers, and 1501/1500 classmates. But any work that you submit should be your own work. If you use someone else's work, you should cite it. If you use someone else's code, you should cite it and make sure that you understand it. Refer to the [University of Toronto's Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm) for full details regarding correct academic behavior and the avoidance of plagiarism.
* You are also expected to provide critical and constructive feedback to your peers. The peer feedback will be graded, and you will be graded on the quality of your feedback.
* **Late-work policy**: under special circumstances, late work will be accepted, but this needs to be requested ahead of the deadline.
